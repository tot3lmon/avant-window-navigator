= About Avant =

Avant Window Navgator is a dock-like bar which sits at the bottom of the screen (in all its composited-goodness) tracking open windows. I suppose this is a good time for a screen shot:

Avant uses libwnck to keep a track of open windows, and behaves exactly like a normal window-list :
  *Clicking an icon switches to that window, clicking again will minimise the window
  *Right-clicking will bring up a menu extactly like that of what you see on the window-list, allowing you to max, min, close, resize etc the window.
  *Dragging something on top of an icon will activate that window.
  *Responds to window "needs attention" & "urgent" events
